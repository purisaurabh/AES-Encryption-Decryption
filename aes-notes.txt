What is AES (Advanced Encryption Standerd)?
-> 1) AES is type of cypher (convert the readable(plaintext) information to unreadable(cyphertext)) that protext the transfer of data through the internet
   2) AES is a symmetric encryption method meaning it used the same key to encrypt data as it does to decrypt data
   3) It also applied multiple rounds of the SPN(Substitution Permutation Network) Algorithm to encrypt the data.
   4) There are three possible lenght of AES keys. Each keys lenght offers a different number of possible key combinations
   5) The higher the bit rate of the AES encryption the more possibilities there are and the higher the security.
   6) AES is Cipher Block
   7) The key size can 128/192/256 bits
   8) Encrypts the data in block of 128 bits each that means it takes 128 bits as an input and outputs 128 buts of encrypted cipher text.
   9) AES relies on the SPN principle which is performed using the series of linked operations that involved replacing and shuffling the input
   
Working : 
	a) AES perform operations on bytes of data rather than bits. Since the block size is 128 bits the cipher processes 128 bits(16 bytes) if the input data 
	   at a time
	b) The number of rounds depends upon the key lenght : 
		1) 128 bit key : 10 rounds
		2) 192 bit key : 12 rounds
		3) 156 bit key : 14 rounds
